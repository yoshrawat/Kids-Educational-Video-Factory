Benny didn't want to share his own toys with Squeaky, so he said, "No way! That's mine!"

**Scene 3: The Lesson**

Narration: "But then Benny remembered something his mom told him: 'Sharing is caring!' So, he took a deep breath and said, 'Okay, Squeaky, you can play with the ball. I'll show you my favorite game instead.'"
