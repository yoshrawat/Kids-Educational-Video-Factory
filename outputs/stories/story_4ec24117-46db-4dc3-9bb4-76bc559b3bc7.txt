Benny had a shiny new ball that he loved to play with. Sammy had a basket full of acorns, but none as big or beautiful as Benny's ball. Lily had a sparkly necklace, but she wished she could share it with her friends.

**Scene 2: Sharing is Caring**

Narration: "One sunny day, the three friends were playing together when Benny accidentally rolled his ball into Sammy's acorn basket."

Sammy was sad because he couldn't play with the ball anymore. But then he remembered something his mom had told him - "Sharing is caring!" So, he offered to share some of his acorns with Benny.

**Scene 3: The Sharing Circle**

Narration: "Benny and Sammy started to share their toys, one by one. Lily joined in too! They made a sharing circle where everyone took turns playing with each other's things."

As they shared, Benny noticed how happy it made his friends feel. He realized that when he shared his ball, Sammy felt special too! And Lily's necklace sparkled even more when she knew her friends were happy.

**Scene 4: The Forest Friends Promise**

Narration: "From that day on, the three friends promised to always share with each other. They made a promise to be kind and caring friends."

The forest was filled with more laughter and joy than ever before! And whenever someone asked what their secret was, they would say in unison - "Sharing is caring!"
